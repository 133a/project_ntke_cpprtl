=====1=====
  WDK versions supporting the driver signing:
    wdk6.1sp1
    wdk7.1.0
    wdk8.0
    wdk8.1
    wdk10


=====2=====
  the certificate generated by the project build script is a self-signed one


=====3=====
  generating the certificate:

--00 it's supposed the build environment is set up as noted in $(PROJECT_ROOT)\project.txt

--01 copy the '.cmd' build script (with the name corresponding to the installed WDK) from the $(PROJECT_ROOT)\make\gmake\bat into the $(PROJECT_ROOT)\ke_mode\winnt\ntke_cpprtl\cpprtl_test_kemode\sign

--02 run the script from the $(PROJECT_ROOT)\ke_mode\winnt\ntke_cpprtl\cpprtl_test_kemode\sign
     the MakeCert.exe will ask for a password for the certificate container but keep the password empty.

--03 if the script run with the administative privileges than the 'cpprtl_test.sign.pfx' certificate would appear in the current folder and become added to the root certificate store.
     if the script run without the administative privileges than the 'cpprtl_test.sign.pfx' certificate would only appear in the current folder, 
     it can be added to the root store later by running the build script with the administrative privileges, in this case the 'cpprtl_test.sign.pfx' will not be reissued but will just be added to the store.

--04 once the certificate is generated it becomes possible to use it for the 'cpprtl_test.sys' driver signing directly while the building process.
     just remove the option 'module.no_signing = 1' from the file $(PROJECT_ROOT)\ke_mode\winnt\ntke_cpprtl\cpprtl_test_kemode\module.mak and start the driver building.
